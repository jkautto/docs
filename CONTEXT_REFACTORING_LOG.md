# Context Refactoring Log - 2025-07-17

This document summarizes the optimization and refactoring of the CAG and Context Library.

## 1. Summary of Changes

The primary goal of this refactoring was to create a single, unambiguous, and token-optimized source of truth for AI development assistants. This was achieved by consolidating information, removing redundancy, and structuring data for machine readability.

### 1.1. CAG Refactoring
- **Archived Monolithic `CAG.md`:** The large, narrative `CAG.md` file was archived to `/srv/docs/archive/CAG_v1_monolithic.md`.
- **Consolidated to `CAG-core.json`:** All structured data, such as paths, service definitions, credentials, and schedules, is now located in `CAG-core.json`. This is the new primary source of truth for configuration.
- **Rewrote `CAG-index.md`:** The index was rewritten to be a clear, concise entry point for any AI agent, pointing to the other specialized `CAG` files.
- **Optimized Markdown Files:** `CAG-architecture.md`, `CAG-operations.md`, and `CAG-learnings.md` were reviewed and edited to be more concise and factual.

### 1.2. Context Library Cleanup
- **Archived Outdated Files:** The following files were moved from `/srv/context/current` to `/srv/docs/archive/` as their content was either outdated or better stored in the main documentation:
    - `mcp-research.md`
    - `pastebin-api-guide.md`
    - `pastebin-knowledge.md`
    - `jtools-inventory.md`
- **Confirmed Structure:** The overall structure of the `/srv/context` library was confirmed to be sound.

## 2. Impact

- **Improved AI Efficiency:** The new structure is significantly more token-efficient and easier for an AI to parse, leading to faster and more accurate responses.
- **Reduced Redundancy:** Duplicate information has been eliminated, reducing the risk of context becoming stale or contradictory.
- **Clearer Entry Point:** `CAG-index.md` now serves as the definitive starting point for any agent needing to understand the system.
