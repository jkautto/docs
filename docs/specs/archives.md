# Specification Archives

Historical specifications preserved for reference.

## Archive Organization

Specifications are archived when:
- Implementation is complete and stable
- Specification is superseded by newer version
- Project is cancelled or indefinitely postponed
- Technology becomes obsolete

## 2025 Archives

### Q1 2025
- **PAI Claude Brain Architecture** - Superseded by current PAI architecture
- **PAI Monitoring Architecture** - Integrated into operations docs
- **PAI Toolkit MVP** - Evolved into current toolkit
- **Personal AI Toolkit v0.1** - Foundation for current implementation

### Completed Implementations
- **Context Library v0.1** - Successfully implemented
- **MkDocs Migration** - Completed and deployed
- **Apps Repository Structure** - Implemented as designed

## 2024 Archives

### jtools Evolution
Early specifications for jtools that laid groundwork for current system:
- Initial toolkit design
- API architecture drafts
- Repository organization plans

### Infrastructure Planning
Original infrastructure specifications that evolved into current architecture:
- Server setup guides
- Service deployment plans
- Security frameworks

## Learning from Archives

### Why Review Archives?
1. **Historical Context** - Understand evolution of systems
2. **Design Decisions** - Learn why certain choices were made
3. **Avoid Repetition** - Don't repeat past mistakes
4. **Reusable Components** - Find code/ideas to repurpose

### Common Patterns in Archives
- Over-engineering in early versions
- Simplified approaches winning
- Security added retroactively
- Documentation improving over time

## Archive Policy

### What to Archive
- Completed specifications
- Cancelled projects (with notes)
- Superseded versions
- Historical documentation

### What NOT to Archive
