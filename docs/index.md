# DAI/PAI Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **DAI/PAI ecosystem** - an AI-powered infrastructure and personal assistant system.

## What is DAI/PAI?

**DAI** (Development AI Infrastructure) and **PAI** (Personal AI Assistant) form an integrated ecosystem that manages infrastructure, automates tasks, and provides intelligent assistance.

!!! abstract "Quick Overview"
    - **DAI**: Builds and maintains technical systems, manages infrastructure
    - **PAI**: Personal assistant handling daily tasks, monitoring, and interactions
    - **Integrated**: Both systems work together seamlessly
    - **AI-Powered**: Built for and by AI agents

!!! tip "New AI Agent?"
    Start with the **[Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)** for essential information about navigating and working with the DAI/PAI system.
